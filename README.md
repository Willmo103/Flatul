# FlaTÜl (Experimental Version)

This project is an experimental version of the original [RepoScribe](https://github.com/your-username/RepoScribe) codebase. The code for this experimental version is based on the release version 2.2.0 of RepoScribe.

## Purpose

The purpose of this experimental version is to create a new personal experiment with added functionality. The original codebase of RepoScribe had become too complex and difficult to maintain, so I decided to create a simplified version with only three files. This uncomplicated state allows me to build on the codebase in a new and more organized way.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/RepoScribe-experimental.git`
